# 🧠 Prompt Vault

A collection of practical system prompts for Microsoft 365, AI adoption, and organizational productivity. 

## What's This?

Real-world prompts I've developed and tested while helping organizations navigate M365 adoption and AI readiness. No fluff, no theory—just prompts that solve actual problems.

## How to Use

1. **Browse the prompts** - Each has a clear use case description
2. **Copy and adapt** - Modify for your specific context
3. **Test thoroughly** - What works for me might need tweaking for you
4. **Share improvements** - PRs welcome if you enhance something

## Categories

- **🔧 Microsoft 365**: Teams governance, SharePoint organization, adoption guidance
- **🤖 AI Readiness**: Copilot optimization, knowledge management, data preparation
- **📊 Decision Support**: Framework generation, analysis workflows
- **🎯 Change Management**: Training content, user guidance, adoption strategies

## Disclaimer

⚠️ **Use at your own risk!** 

These prompts are shared as-is, based on my experience. They might not fit your specific context, compliance requirements, or organizational needs. Always test in a safe environment and adapt for your situation.

I'm not responsible for what happens if you use these in production. You've been warned. 😉
